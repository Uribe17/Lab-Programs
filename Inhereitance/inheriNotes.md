**INHERITANCE**

- Inheritance is a mechanism for enchancing existing working classes.
  
- If a new class needs to be implemented & a class representing a more general concept is already available, then the new class can _inherit_ from the existing class.
  
- The existing, more general class is called base class.
  
- In the derived class definition, you specify only new member functions and data function.
