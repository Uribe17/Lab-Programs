RECURSIONS- 
-
For a recursion to be successful:
  1. Every recursive call must simplify the computation.
  2. 
Recursions must have a:
  1. Base case/terminating case
  2. Repeatable Sequence

To think recursively:
  Step 1: Consider various ways of simplifying inputs.
  Step 2: Combine solutions with simpler inputs to a solution
  Step 3: Find solutions to the simplest inputs.
  Step 4:
  Step 5:

Efficiency of Recursions:
- For study, the fibonacci sequence is defined by: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, Fn = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1.



Permutations-
-
- A permutation is a rearrangement of the ltetters.
- If a string has n letters, the # of permutaations is given by this factoral
